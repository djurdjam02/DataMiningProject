# DataMiningProject - Analysis, classification and clustering of protein blocks
The goal of this project was to perform a detailed descriptive and predictive analysis of rare transitions between protein blocks. The analysis revealed several interesting insights, including which amino acids and secondary structures are most commonly involved in these transitions. It was also shown that protein blocks can be predicted significantly more accurately than other structural elements using classification algorithms. This project was developed as part of the Data Mining 2 course at the Faculty of Mathematics.
